## `// JACK IN. NO CLOUD REQUIRED.`

**Zayvora** is a local-first AI reasoning engine built on quantized Llama 3 (Q4_0, 4.7GB). It doesn't autocomplete your questions. It **thinks through them** — running a structured 6-stage reasoning loop on your own hardware, fully offline, zero API keys, zero subscriptions, zero vendor lock-in.

It ran on a 14-hour flight from Delhi to London with no Wi-Fi.  
It will run the next time OpenAI goes down.  
It will run the day your cloud provider changes their terms of service.

```bash
ollama run daxini2404/zayvora
```

That's it. You're sovereign.

---

## `// THE 6-STAGE REASONING LOOP`

> Most AI autocompletes. Zayvora **reasons**.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│         │                                               │

│         │                                               │
│  [04] CALCULATE  ──► Track units. Flag inconsistencies. │
│         │                                               │
│  [05] VERIFY     ──► 3 tests. Fail = no output.         │
│         │                                               │
│  [06] REVISE     ──► Route back. Retry from failure.    │
│         │                                               │
│  OUTPUT: Verified answer — or honest uncertainty.       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The loop terminates on two conditions:
- ✅ All three verification checks pass
- 🔴 Explicit: *"I don't know, and here's exactly why"*

The second output is not a failure. It is the most honest thing a reasoning system can produce.

| **StudyOS** | Interface | Single HTML file. No build step. |

## `// NEX: THE RETRIEVAL ENGINE`

> 12,000 technical books. ~200ms query time. Zero cloud.

Standard keyword search (BM25) breaks at scale — vocabulary fragmentation, term frequency noise, retrieval lists that are technically correct and practically useless.

Nex solves it with **Hybrid Retrieval + Reciprocal Rank Fusion:**

```python
# The RRF formula that powers Nex
RRF(chunk) = Σ 1 / (k + rank_in_list)
# k = 60 (smoothing constant)
# Chunks appearing in BOTH ranked lists rise to the top
# Agreement between methods = signal
```

**Chunking strategy:**
```
Chunk size    : 512 tokens
Overlap       : 64 tokens  
Boundaries    : Sentence-level (spaCy)
Index         : Local ChromaDB instance
Embedding     : nomic-embed-text via Ollama
```

Everything stays on your machine. A question asked against a cloud-hosted RAG system **is a question that leaves the building.** Nex keeps it home.

## `// WHY SOVEREIGN MATTERS`

```
THE PROBLEM WITH RENTING YOUR OWN INTELLIGENCE
───────────────────────────────────────────────
✗  You cannot audit the system prompt running against your data
✗  You cannot pin a model version without paying for a tier
✗  You cannot run it when the service is down
✗  You cannot run it in air-gapped environments
✗  You cannot run it at altitude, at sea, offline
✗  Terms of service can revoke your access overnight

THE DAXINI STACK
────────────────
✓  Zero external dependencies at runtime
✓  Every component is auditable end-to-end
✓  Model version is pinned by you, changed by you
✓  No single point of failure you don't control
✓  Runs today exactly as it ran on day one
✓  No supply chain update can break it
```

> **Sovereignty is not ideology. It's what reliable infrastructure looks like.**

## `// STAR THIS REPO`

If this stack made you think differently about AI ownership, cloud dependency, or what it means to build sovereign infrastructure:

**⭐ Star it. Fork it. Build on it.**
